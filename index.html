        <h1 class="title">The Allegiance!</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p1>Mourad Ghaly is a young philosopher-engineer, a seeker of truth and beauty. He believes that innovation is the key to a better future, and that the human mind, with its infinite capacity for creativity and problem-solving, is our greatest asset.

                Mourad's brain is a microcosm of the universe, a complex and interconnected system of ideas and passions. Like the heart, it <span> blood</span> throughout the body, giving life to all that it sustains. But Mourad's heart is not simply a biological organ; it is also a metaphor for his ambition and his desire to make a difference in the world.
                
                Mourad's <span class="AA">Artistic Atria</span> represent his creative side, his love for beauty and harmony. This is where his passion for <span class="AA">cars and music (guitar) resides</span>. He loves to use his creativity to come up with new and innovative ideas, and he enjoys expressing himself through engines and music.
                
                Mourad's <span class"PV>Practical Ventricles</span> represent his analytical side, his ability to think critically and solve problems. This is where his <span class="PV">computational mind and biological curiosity lie</span>. He is fascinated by the inner workings of the universe, both natural and artificial. He loves to use his technical skills to solve complex problems and design new and innovative solutions.
                
                It is through the fusion of these two forces that Mourad is able to generate truly innovative solutions. He is able to take his creative ideas and turn them into practical solutions that can make a real difference in the world.
                
                Mourad's brain is also a conductor, sparking his ambition and guiding him towards his goals. At dawn, he wakes up with a vision, a blueprint for a better future. This vision is the driving force behind his work, and it is what motivates him to push the boundaries of what is possible.
                
                Mourad uses his philosophical heart conduction system to implement his own syncytium into the business world. He uses his creative and analytical skills to develop new and innovative products and services. He also uses his ability to think critically and solve problems to overcome challenges and obstacles.
                
                Mourad is determined to make a difference in the world, and he is using his talents and skills to achieve his goals. He knows that the left ventricle is responsible for the beginning of the systemic circulation, and that's why he decided in his childhood that he is going to promote his computer science learning throughout self learning, until Mourad began to be heavily immersed in under-graduate programs to invest in knowledge which he is sure and certain to pursue higher education in. Mourad's fate lies in the hands of god, himself and computer science, he believes that computer science is the left ventricle, his gateway to the world.
                
                Mourad's analogy between computer science and the left ventricle is a powerful one. The left ventricle is the most important chamber of the heart, and it is responsible for pumping blood to the rest of the body. In the same way, computer science is the foundation of many other fields, and it is essential for innovation and progress.
                
                Mourad's passion for computer science and his belief in its power to change the world are truly inspiring. He is a role model for young people who are interested in technology and who want to make a difference in the world.    </p1>
