            <p1>I've always aspired to become a pioneer in life, I always valued innovation. But the problem is that I am multidisciplinary, I love and know countless things! <br>
            The pledge has always been about pursuing higher education in computer science. And from there I could debute in the cybersecurity market, I always wanted to be in the business of selling legal spyware. But as you grow up, you become much more mature. And that maturity made me have a broader perspective, 
                a certain opening to new ideas. As someone who always lived under a certain "medical" environement which was crafted by my family full of physicians! So, I realised that the legacy which was built by this bloodline would all have the fate of extinction. Therefore, the goal is now to attempt to pursue my passion and maintain my family's legacy simultaneously. Not to mention that I was always had a thing for medicine!       </p1>
